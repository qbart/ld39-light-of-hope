# Light of hope - Ludum Dare 39 (Compo)

![cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qbart/ld39-light-of-hope/master/Release/LightOfHope.png)

Your name is George and you are a lighthouse keeper.
You came to work and you just realised that all clockwork mechanisms are broken. Time to do things manually...

Your mission is to guide all lost sailors to their homes.

## Controls:

[ d ][ f ] - rotate lightbeam towards the ships.

[ j ][ k ] - keep hitting these keys interchangeably as fast as you can (and don't stop) to keep the light on and bright (brighter light = sailors will turn ships faster).

Good luck!
